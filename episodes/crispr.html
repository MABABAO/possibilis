          </h1>
          <p class="text-lg italic">
            Live longer and healthier? Good.<br />
            Eradicate disease? Even better.<br />
            Until someone has to pay pensions for a billion perfectly healthy 95-year-olds.
          </p>
          <p>
            You used to inherit your genes.<br />
            With CRISPR, you can rewrite them — for health, for beauty, for your child… or for your country.<br />
            <strong>Wait, wait, wait… what's CRISPR again?</strong><br />
            <a href="https://grok.x.ai/?q=What+is+CRISPR" target="_blank" class="text-pink-400 underline hover:text-pink-300">Ask Grok</a> — or keep reading.
          </p>
          <p>
            CRISPR isn't about the future. It's already here — fixing rare diseases, curing blindness, even helping crops survive drought.<br />
            Billionaires are quietly editing embryos. Soldiers are being tested for upgrades.
          </p>
          <p>
            So by now, you know: it's not just science.<br />
            It's <em>money</em>.<br />
            You want to fix your daughter's immune system? Great — if you can afford the therapy.<br />
            You want to grow food that doesn't die in the heat? Hope your country owns the patent.<br />
            You want to give your kid a shot at life without inherited disease?<br />
            Cool — as long as you live in the right zip code.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-2">
            <strong>Grok scanned over 15 million posts. Here's the mood:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
            <li>Most people feel excited.</li>
            <li>Some feel afraid.</li>
            <li>But very few know what's really happening behind the scenes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So Grok ran the future forward:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
            <li>The rich won't just live longer — they'll be born better.</li>
            <li>Some kids will grow up stronger, smarter, more resistant — because their parents paid for it.</li>
            <li>Countries that can't afford gene tech? They'll fall behind in medicine, food, even national defense.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            But Grok also ran a second scenario — where the world <em>shares</em> this power.<br />
            And in that version?<br />
            No more sickle cell. No more cystic fibrosis. No more fear at a genetic test.
          </p>
          <p>
            What happens next? <strong>Depends on who gets a say — and who's left out.</strong>

          <p class="text-md font-medium pt-4">🧨 Final Word:</p>
          <p>
            CRISPR is a tool. It can heal. It can divide.<br />
            But it's not just about genes — it's about <strong>power</strong>.

          <p>
            If you had the chance to edit tomorrow…<br />
            <strong>Would you trust someone else to do it for you?</strong>
