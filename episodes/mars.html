          </h1>
          <p class="text-lg italic">
            "AI replacing jobs, society is fragmenting, future uncertain—<br />
            Is Mars an escape pod from Earth's failures, or a chance to build something that actually works?"
          </p>

          <p class="pt-4">
            Elon Musk is 53. Mars takes 30 years. He's rushing because he sees something—not a meteor (we'd all see it), something in his domain. AI collapse? Coordination failure? He won't say exactly. But watch how he works—sleeping at SpaceX, pushing "Elon time" deadlines that seem impossible. That's not entrepreneurship. That's someone who thinks the clock is ticking.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-orange-300 pt-4">❓ The Questions Nobody Wants to Ask</h2>
          
          <p class="pt-2">
            <strong>Can humans reproduce at 0.38G?</strong> We don't know. No testing. Are we sending only young adults? Does age matter for cumulative damage? If we edit genes to adapt, do we create Homo Ares—a species that can't breed with Earth humans?
          </p>

          <p class="pt-3">
            <strong>Who owns the machinery that keeps you alive?</strong> Elon said "no countries on Mars." Sounds free—until you break expensive equipment. Can the company make you work off debt? For life? What about your kids—born free or born owing? No countries = no courts, no labor laws, no rights.
          </p>

          <p class="text-md font-semibold pt-4 text-orange-200">
            First generation accepts this because they're desperate to go.<br />
            Second generation wakes up in corporate feudalism.<br />
            <strong>Mars won't have Earth's problems—it'll have new ones we're not discussing.</strong>
          </p>

          <p class="text-md font-medium pt-4">🔥 Final Word:</p>
          <p>
            Elon has 30 years left to make this work. Maybe less.<br />
            The clock is ticking. The questions remain unanswered.<br />
            <strong>Mars won't wait for us to figure it out.</strong>
