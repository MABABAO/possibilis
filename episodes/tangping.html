        <p class="text-lg italic text-gray-300">"You work. You save. You grind. And still — you can't afford rent. Why bother?"</p>
        <p class="text-md text-gray-400">
          That's the philosophy behind <strong>躺平</strong> — "Lying Flat." Not laziness. Not rebellion. Just defeat by design.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-gray-400">
          From China's ghost cities to unaffordable urban housing, a generation is giving up on homeownership, on children, on the future.
          Not because they want to — but because <strong>the math broke</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-gray-400">
          You're not bidding against people. You're bidding against <strong>pension funds</strong>, <strong>hedge funds</strong>, and <strong>shell companies</strong>.
          That's the chasm: not rich vs. poor — but humans vs. systems.
