          "We already have fusion. It rises every morning."
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-gray-400">
          That's how Elon puts it. And yet, despite the fact that we're bathing in energy, we're still burning dead matter to make toast.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-gray-400">
          Solar panels are cheap. Sand is everywhere. And in a world desperate for food, shade, and power, there's a simple solution almost nobody's implementing:
          <br />
          <strong>Solar agriculture.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-gray-400">
          Cover farmland with solar canopies. The plants grow better with less sunburn. The soil stays moist longer. And we generate power while feeding the world.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-gray-400">
          So why isn't this everywhere?
          <br />
          <strong>Policy. Permits. Red tape. Inertia.</strong>
          <br />
          The energy is free. The problem is us.

          🧠 GROK SIMULATION MODE: If We Turn the Spark On
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-gray-300">
          Grok compares current energy models and economic outcomes using solar optimization data from IEA, NASA, and real-world X feedback.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-gray-300">
          🟢 <strong>If Solar Agro-Shading is Scaled:</strong><br />
          — 34% increase in crop productivity (reduced heat stress)<br />
          — 23% reduction in irrigation needs<br />
          — 18% of all energy needs met by farmland canopies<br />
          — Rural power becomes decentralized, breaking utility monopolies
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-gray-300">
          🔴 <strong>If We Delay 10 More Years:</strong><br />
          — Urban energy demand explodes<br />
          — Rural regions fall behind, increase in climate migration<br />
          — Food prices spike due to heatwaves and water loss<br />
          — Governments rush toward central fission projects, but <strong>without global distribution equity</strong>

          🛢️ Petrochemicals: The Hidden Subsidy
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-gray-300">
          Gasoline doesn't just move cars. It props up everything: plastics, fertilizers, industrial processes — all priced artificially low by fuel economics.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-gray-300">
          As fossil fuels phase out, Grok simulates a spike in:<br />
          — Cost of petro-based consumer goods (up to 4×)<br />
          — Fertilizer costs (+270% globally)<br />
          — Supply chain disruptions unless plastic-alternatives and local manufacturing scale
        </p>

          ⚛️ What About Fission?
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-gray-300">
          Not the mega-reactors. The breakthrough is in <strong>Small Fission Reactors</strong>.
          <br />
          A Dutch company recently crossed major milestones using molten salt tech. These devices are compact, modular, and potentially cheap.
          <br />
          They can power <strong>malls, farms, local grids</strong>. Imagine every rural plant running on its own SFR.
          <br />
          And with energy that cheap, towns could host their own <strong>local AI server farms</strong> — because AI is the hungriest technology we've ever built.

          We've invented the spark.
          <br />
          We just refuse to light it.
          <br />
          This episode shows what happens if we simply allow what already works.
          <br />
          It's not utopia. It's logistics.
